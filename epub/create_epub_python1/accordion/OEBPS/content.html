    <h1>Accordion</h1>
    <div>This thesis presents different techniques for achieving different
kinds of anonymity in computer networks. In the first part of the
thesis, the techniques are described and their anonymity properties
are analyzed. Also, in the first part a survey of various existing
peer-to-peer, anonymizing systems is presented.

In the second part of the thesis, a design and a prototype
implementation of an anonymous, low-latency, peer-to-peer file storage
system, Accordion, built on practical and efficient DC-networks is
presented and its anonymity properties analyzed. The system offers
sender anonymity for publishers of files and for the nodes in the
network that store the files. The prototype is tested in different
ways to increase confidence in the design.</div>
